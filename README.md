## Ripcord
# Alternative desktop chat client for Slack (and Discord)
Ripcord is a desktop chat client for group-centric services like Slack and Discord. 
It provides a traditional compact desktop interface designed for power users. 
It's not built on top of web browser technology: it has a small resource footprint, responds quickly to input, and gets out of your way.
Shareware is coming back, baby.
Ripcord is developed independently, and is not affiliated with Slack or Discord.
